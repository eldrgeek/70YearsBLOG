If you’ve landed on this web page, or gotten this in your email, you are special. Yes, you!1I don’t care if you are the second person here or the 1,000,000th or anywhere in between.I don’t care if we know one another or have never met.I don’t care if I’m dead and this page is still hanging around as a reminder that I was once alive.You’re alive. And that is special.Most of the universe is dead. You were dead (or at least not alive) for more than 13.75 billion years. But right now, you’re alive, and reading this.That makes you specialCelebrate it!If you have a friend who needs to be reminded that they are special, send it to them.I’m not going to add a self-serving sign-up-for-this-blog button.Instead I’ll add a “Don’t Subscribe to this Publication” button. You can not subscribe without clicking it. But you’ll probably click it the same way that people touch things that have “Wet Paint” signs on them. No matter. You won’t be subscribed whatever you do. Unless you already are.Don't subscribe to this publication!1Especially you, John.
