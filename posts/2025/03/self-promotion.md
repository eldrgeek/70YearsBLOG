I’ve written this blog since I was 70. Now, (as I write this) I’m 821. And every day, older. For the first many years, it was a write-only blog. Not even I read it My kids might sometimes have read it, but I didn’t care2. I was only in it for the writing.Eventually, I started reading what I had written. And I liked it. I still do. Those Past Me’s3 were quite the dudes. I hope the Future Me’s (same link) feels likewise and appreciates Present Me (same, again.) And by the way, this post (same link) was a game-changer for me.Heaven with slower internetNow, I’m living in the afterlife, which I have described as “like heaven, but with slower internet.”The joys and woes of SubstackI moved from Google’s Blogspot to Substack in 2021. After several years, I tried addingSubscribe nowbuttons. I got a few subscribers4 You’d think that would be cool. But, as I wrote in this “draft” blog post having subscribers was a pain in the ass. (same link)I became self-conscious about my writing. What if what I wrote didn’t meet the standard set by whatever I’d written that inspired someone to sign up? What if I disappointed people by not posting enough? What if I was losing it? What was the “it” that I was losing?Something changedBut something changed. My mind, of course. What else can change?And I went on a Hero’s Journey and stopped trying to play it both ways: trying to be visible and invisible.I’ve decided to be visible.I like the shit I write. I’ve decided to make it visible.I’m not “self-” promoting because I may have no self.I’m going to write more. There’s the book I wrote in 2021, “Self-Referential Metanovel Writing for Dummies.” I’m going to edit it, republish it, and promote it.It needs visibility.Link to FREE outrageous AI-generated podcastLink to FREE PDF cover(Link to FREE PDF manuscript) (Link to CHEAP, badly formatted Kindle eBook5) (Link to less cheap but quite cost-effective paperback6) And I’ve got another book I’m going to write. A metanovel, of course.“Finally!” says The God I Don’t Believe in, who has helped me write the book and everything else I write. “Finally!”Some people will like what I write. If that’s you, and you’re not a subscriber:Subscribe nowOr don’t. I love you either way.Some people won’t like it. If that’s you, go fuck yourself7. But I say it with love.So this is me, coming out in the open. Thanks, Grok, for the images.Subscribe or don’t. I love you the same.1Not now, as you you read this. Now, as I write this. I won’t update this post every time I get a year older, FFS.2Well, I did care. But it would spoil the narrative to say that.3Yeah, I know it’s not a possessive or a contraction. But it looks stupid if I say Mes instead of Me’s.4I’m now up to 70 subscribers! Not now, as you read this. Now, as I write this. I won’t update this post every time someone new subscribes, FFS.5Trust me, the formatting is shit. But it’s out there. So yay.6Used to be on Lulu but somehow got deleted. Now working on publishing on Amazon.7Really, I still love you.
